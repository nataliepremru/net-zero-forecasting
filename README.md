# UK Net Zero Forecasting

## Aim
This project sets out to analyse data from ONS on the evolution (over 30 years) of renewable energy usage in the UK and make predicitions on whether the UK Gov are on target for Net Zero plans.

## Overview
The project begins with some exploratory data analysis through data visualisations such as box plots, histograms and correlation matrices to spot trends in the data and highlight inconsistencies. It using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forests and SVR for predictive modelling and ARIMA for Time-Series forecasting. From these results it draws insights on what reneable energy usage will look like in 2030 and 2050, and whether thius aligns with the UK Gov's plans for Net Zero.

## Notes
Some issues found a long the way were:
1. The data set is fairly small (only 30 rows), making accurate foreceasting difficult.
3. The UK Gov's plans for Net Zero set specific targets for the use of renewables for electricity generation while the data set covers only energy as a whole. The project could draw more meaningful insights if there was a way to make predicitions specifically for electricty generation.
